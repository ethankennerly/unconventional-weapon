Games and puzzles

Anagrams are in themselves a recreational activity, but they also make up part of many other games, puzzles and game shows.

Cryptic crossword puzzles frequently use anagrammatic clues, usually indicating that they are anagrams by the inclusion of a descriptive term like "confused" or "in disarray". An example would be Businessman burst into tears (9 letters). The solution, stationer, is an anagram of into tears, the letters of which have burst out of their original arrangement to form the name of a type of businessman.
In Scrabble, the players must make words by placing lettered tiles on a grid to score points in an effort to have scored more points than the opponent at the end of the game. A version of Scrabble called Clabbers, the name itself being an anagram of Scrabble, allows for tiles to be placed in any order on the board as long as they anagram to a valid word.
In Boggle, players make words from a grid of sixteen random letters by joining adjacent cubes to make valid words.
On the British game show Countdown, contestants are given 30 seconds to make the longest word from nine random letters. One point is awarded per letter of the word, or 18 points (double) for using all nine letters. An example of a 9-letter word: s, a, a, p, i, o, n, j, c, forms "Japonicas."
On the British game show BrainTeaser, contestants are shown a word broken into randomly arranged segments and must announce the whole word. At the end of the game there is a "Pyramid" which starts with a three-letter word. A letter appears in the line below to which the player must add the existing letters to find a solution. The pattern continues until the player reaches the final eight-letter anagram. The player wins the game by solving all the anagrams within the allotted time.
The Jumble is a puzzle found in many newspapers in the United States requiring the unscrambling of letters to find the solution.
Anagrammatic is a game on Miniclip where anagrams are formed.

REFERENCE COGNITION
ABSTRACT 4 groups of 20 Ss each were presented with a set of 21 multiple-solution anagram problems and 2 additional groups of 20 Ss each received 21 single-solution problems, in which the anagram was itself a word. An S-R mediational model or problem-solving behavior was employed to make predictions concerning the effects of 4 variables, viz., anagram letter order, solution-word Thorndike-Lorge frequency, anagram digram frequency, and solution-word digram frequency, on anagram solution times. All predictions of the model were confirmed and the results showed that for multiple- as well as single-solution anagram problems, solution times are faster for easy letter orders, high solution-word Thorndike-Lorge frequencies, low anagram digram frequencies, and high solution-word digram frequencies.
